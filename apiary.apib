# New JVB API without installment
API documentation for Lymet API.

## Getting started
This online document describes Lymet API - the means for partner e-shops through which they can offer their customers the benefits of one of Home Credit's payment method.

The aim of here described services is to allow customers the smooth running through the process of an online purchase. The services that allow achieving this goal are divided into the following groups:

| Group of services       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---                     | ---                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Security                | Security rules and principles                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Application operations  | Services that allows processing of *application* and *order* during their whole lifecycle                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Precheck operations     | Services that allow partner e-shops find out a probability of *application's* approval and limits of particular *customer*, if known to Lymet                                                        |
| Merchantsite operations | Services that should be developed and exposed by partner e-shops to allow Lymet asynchronously inform these partner e-shops about important changes regarding particular *applications* and *orders* |
| Health check            | Health check usage description                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Basic implementation
The most basic and minimum way how to implement Lymet API is to at least implement:
1. [Login](#reference/security/login-partner)
    - Needed for all operations.
1. [Create application](#reference/application-operations/create-application)
    - Called with all order and customer data after finishing the order.
1. Redirect handlers.
    - Special URLs for customers that shows payment success or rejection.
1. [Application notification](#reference/merchantsite-operations/application-notification)
1. [Generate invoice info](#reference/application-operations/invoices/generate-invoice-info)
    - To put all the necessary information to invoices (correct due date, bank number...). 
1. [Mark order items as sent](#reference/application-operations/mark-order-items-as-sent)  or [Mark order items as delivered](#reference/application-operations/mark-order-items-as-delivered) (depends when merchant invoices the order)
    - Lymet won't send money if the order (order items) is not marked as `SENT` / `DELIVERED`.

[![Sequence diagram of minimum implementation](https://github.com/mdostal-hci/oneclick-images/raw/master/SequenceDiagramMinimum.png)](https://github.com/mdostal-hci/oneclick-images/raw/master/SequenceDiagramMinimum.png)

It's always needed to send all attributes marked as required, but filling optional parameters will result in better application approval rate. You should always consider to fill the most attributes as possible. Contact the sales support to find out which attributes correlate with approval rate the most.


### Advanced implementation
You can use advanced operations to improve customer experience.

1. [Precheck](#reference/precheck-operations/precheck)
    - Merchant can prevent customer to be redirected to Lymet gateway if the customer is not suitable for Lymet by precheck operation.
1. Operations to integrate Lymet better in merchant checkout:
    - [Request application OTP](#reference/application-operations/request-application-otp)
    - [Verify application](#reference/application-operations/verify-application)
    - [Send application additional data](#reference/application-operations/send-application-additional-data)

    > IMPORTANT NOTE: Despite the usage of these operations it's always necessary to check *application* `stateReason`. If `stateReason == PROCESSING_REDIRECT_NEEDED` there is no way how to complete *application* throught API calls and you have to redirect customer to `gatewayRedirectUrl`.

## Naming conventions
- we use camelCase for all object and attribute names
- we use CAPITAL_UNDERSCORE for enum values
- we use plural in resource names

## Paging
- some resources (stated in documentation) that return collection of objects support pagination. We are using technique known as 'cursor-based pagination'.
- on request:
  - query parameter `limit` specifies maximum number of objects in returned collection
  - query parameter `after` specifies last object retrieved in previous request. Its value is usually `id` of last object retrieved in previous call, but this will be stated in documentation. Parameter `after` is used when traversing collection forwards.
  - query parameter `before` specifies first object retrieved in previous request (analogy to `after` parameter), and is used when traversing collection backwards.
  - if `before` and `after` are omitted, beginning of collection is returned, using specified sort order
  - items in collection are always sorted accoridng to attribute which could be passed in after/before parameters. Even if you specify different sorting order, this attribute will be last sorting criterion; if you do not specify sorting order, result collection will be sorted according to this attribute.
- on response:
  - `pagingInfo` object is returned as part of response body with following attributes:
    - _nextPage_ - request to retrieve next page. Either nextPage or previousPage is returned, depending whether you specify `after` or `before` parameter. If you specify neither `before` nor `after` parameter, these attributes will be omitted from response.
    - _prevPage_ - request to retrieve previous page (see `nextPage` attribute description above).
    - _itemsPerPage_ - number of items per page


Example request:
```
curl -X GET https://api.homecredit.cz/financing/v1/examples?sort=category&limit=10&after=15
```

Example response pagingInfo:

```javascript
"pagingInfo": {
    "nextPage": "/examples?sort=category&limit=10&after=15"
    "itemsPerPage": 10,
}
```

## Sorting
- some resources (stated in documentation) supports result sorting. You can specify sorting attributes and order using `sort` request parameter. For ascending order, specify just attribute name; for descending order, add unary - in front of attribute name. You can specify multiple attributes for sorting, separated by comma.
- each resource that supports sorting specifies list of attributes that can be used for sorting.

Examples:
- `/public/fxrates?sort=currencyCode` - get list of FX rates sorted by attribute currencyCode
- `/public/branches?sort=-name` - get list of branches, sorted by attribute name in descending order
- `/banking/accounts?sort=accountType,-accountCurrency,accountName` - get list of accounts, sorted by type (ascending), then by currency descending and then by account name (ascending)


## Filtering
Some resources (stated in documentation) supports results filtering. Such resources have list of filters specified together with possible operations and possible values.

You can specify filtering by passing `filter` attribute. General pattern to specify filter is:

`<filterName>|<operator>|<values>`

- `filterName` - filter name from documentation
- `operator` - operator, specified in resource documentation
- `values` - one or more values for filter. Multiple values are separated by comma

Multiple filters can be specified on each request, separated by semi-colon. They are joined by "AND", so each result item must satisfy all conditions.


### Filtering examples
- get a list of partners with category in (1, 5, 10)
```
GET /general/partners?filter=category|in|1,5,10
```

- get a list of contracts with contractDate in (2016-02-10, 2016-04-28>
```
GET /general/contracts?filter=contractDate|gt|2016-02-10;contractDate|lteq|2016-04-28
```


### List of operators
| Operator | Meaning                |
| ---      | ---                    |
| lt       | less than              |
| lteq     | less than or equals    |
| eq       | equals                 |
| gteq     | greater than or equals |
| gt       | greater than           |
| in       | value in list          |

## API calls limits
When you reach API calls limit (you call our API more times than is your quota), you receive HTTP error 429. To inform you about limits we use following response headers:
- `X-Rate-Limit-Limit` - The number of allowed requests in the current period
- `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` - The number of remaining requests in the current period
- `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` - The number of seconds left in the current period


## Response encoding
Unless stated otherwise, all responses are sent as `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`


## HTTP status codes
We use following status codes throughout the API, except for OAuth flow when response codes are prescribed in RFC
- 200 `OK` - request was successful
- 201 `Created` - request was successfull and resource was created
- 204 `No Content` - we accepted your request but there is nothing to return (e.g. response is empty)
- 400 `Bad Request` - syntax error, e.g. request is missing required parameters/attributes or parameter values are of incorrect type
- 401 `Unauthorized` - your API key is wrong or user not authorized (not logged in)
- 403 `Forbidden` - access denied (e.g. user / application is not allowed to use the resource)
- 404 `Not Found` - resource could not be found
- 405 `Method Not Allowed` - specified method is not allowed for resource
- 422 `Unprocessable Entity` -  business (semantic) errors. Request is well-formed, but cannot be processed (e.g. payment due date is in past). Errors are specified in response body (see below)
- 429 `Too Many Requests` - you exceeded the rate limit (see section [API calls limit](#introduction/api-calls-limits) above)
- 500 `Internal Server Error` - something went wrong on our side
- 503 `Service Unavailable` - there is planned service outage


## Error handling
Besides HTTP status codes, which are the main indication if something goes wrong, we also use `errors` object to report more details about errors.

Errors object example:
```javascript
{
    ...

    errors: [
        {
            "code": "ERR_100",
            "message": "Invalid contract number",
            "severity": "ERROR",
            "attribute": "partyAccount.accountNumber",          // optional
            "ticketId": "UAT1:AMS:20160516-091658.450:45e4" // optional
        },
        {
            "code": 352,
            "message": "Insufficiend funds for payment order realization",
            "severity": "WARN"
        },
        {
            "code": 523,
            "message": "This order will trigger currency exchange operation",
            "severity": "INFO"
        }
    ]
}
```

Error object attributes
| Attribute name | Description                                                     |
| ---            | ---                                                             |
| code           | unique error code                                               |
| message        | human readable error description (non-localized)                |
| severity       | error severity ([see below](#error-severity))                   |
| attribute      | json path of request attribute that caused the error (optional) |
| ticketId       | internal ticket ID, used for error backtracking                 |

<a name="error-severity"></a>
There are 3 levels of error severity:
- `ERROR` - critical error, execution cannot continue. This MUST be indicated also by appropriate HTTP status code (`422 Unprocessable Entity`)
- `WARN` - non-critical error, execution can continue but further user interaction is advisable (for request to proceed, you MUST specify this error code in `override` request attribute). This MIGHT be indicated also by appropriate HTTP status code.
- `INFO` - information only, execution can continue without user interaction.

### Errors overview
| Status code | Code                  | Explanation                                                                     | Message                                                                                                        |
| ---         | ---                   | ---                                                                             | ---                                                                                                            |
| 400         | INVALID_REQUEST       | Request was not well formatted (malformed request syntax, size too large, etc.) | (*Various messages possible*) e.g. Unsupported combination of application state and order state                |
| 404         | OBJECT_NOT_FOUND      | The requested resource could not be found                                       | (*Various messages possible*) e.g. Specified object was not found        
|                                      
| 500         | INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR | Unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.  | (*Various messages possible*) e.g. Failed to parse given JSON                                                  |


## Formats
- **date** and **time** uses [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) formatting, e.g.:
  - date is represented as `YYYY-mm-dd`. Timezone (local) is added when necessary.
    - time is represented as `Thh:mm:ss`. Timezone is added when necessary. Time with arbitrary number of digits respresenting miliseconds is also accepted (when [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format criteria is met) but the time without miliseconds is always returned.
  - day of week is represented as number 1..7, with 1 being Monday
  - week no. 1 is the week with the year's first Thursday in it
- **phone numbers** uses international format starting with '+' and including country code (example of valid number: `+420739111222`)
- **numbers format** number format is defined by [JSON standard](http://www.json.org), e.g. decimals are separated by `.`
- **money format** uses [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) formatting (in minor units, e.g.: 12590 represents 125,90 CZK)


## Documentation principles
- attributes in request/response object are optional, unless stated otherwise (`required` flag under attribute name)
- required attribute in optional object means, that if optional object is specified, it must contain required attribute.
- all values in request/response attributes are just examples, except for enum values - these are the only possible values for given attribute.


# Group Security
To access our API, you have to obtain *access token* first; this token is a string of arbitrary length (30+ chars) and it has to be included in HTTP header to every request to API. This section describes way to obtain valid access token and use it to access protected resources.

- to obtain access token, use `/authentication/v1/partner` resource with appropriate parameters (see the [`/authentication/v1/partner` resource documentation](#reference/security/login-partner))

- access token should be present in every request using request header `Authorization`, with type `Bearer`. If your access token has value `secret_token`, it should be specified as follows:

`Authorization: Bearer secret_token`

So the real example using curl will look like:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer secret_token" https://api.homecredit.cz/financing/v1/applications
```

- access token has limited time validity (for 2 hours). After it is expired, you have to obtain new one using `/authentication/v1/partner` resource.

- if you fail to specify access token, you will receive `401 Unauthorized` error and following response body:

```
{
   "error_description": "The access token is missing",
   "error": "invalid_request"
}
```

- if you provide invalid access token, you will receive `401 Unauthorized` error and following response body:

```
{
    "error_description":"The access token is invalid or has expired",
    "error":"invalid_token"
}
```

> IMPORTANT NOTE: You must keep your access token and login credentials safe. NEVER put login credentials nor access token into client page. If you plan to integrate API calls in client flow without submitting the page to server, you should implement REST endpoint bound to your shopping basket session, that will be used as a proxy to call Lymet API.

> NEVER transfer access token nor login credentials over plain HTTP. Such requests will be refused.


## Login partner [/authentication/v1/partner]

### Login partner [POST]

# Group Application operations
Services that allows processing of *application* and *order* during their whole lifecycle.

## Create application [/financing/v1/applications]
Elementary flow starts when customer wants to use one of Home Credit's payment method for financing his purchase made in partner e-shop.

| Financing type     | Supported |
| ---                | ---       |
| `DEFERRED_PAYMENT` | YES       |

Use `/financing/v1/applications` resource with properly filled request that contains at least following data
- Customer information
  - Name (first name and last name - if possible, otherwise full name)
  - E-mail
  - Phone number
- Order details
  - Number
  - Total Price (including VAT)
  - Total VAT (array of total amounts split by VAT rates)
  - Addresses (array, at least one item is required - type BILLING)
    - Country
    - City
    - Street
    - Street number
    - ZIP
    - Address type
  - Order items (array, at least one item is required)
    - Code
    - Order item name
    - Total price (all pieces, including VAT)
    - Total VAT
- Financing type
- Details of selected financing type (if required depends on selected financing type)
- Personal data processing agreement
- Additional information necessary for the continuation and completion of the process
  - Your URL where the customer should be redirected after application approval
  - Your URL where the customer should be redirected after application rejection
  - URL of your notification endpoint you want us to send you notifications about particular application updates

If the request was successfully processed, you receive HTTP status code 201 and *application* object with at least following information in the response:
- Application unique ID
- Application state
- Application substate
- Gateway redirect URL where you should redirect a customer after processing of the response

If the request was recognized as duplication, you receive HTTP status code 200 and the *application* object created during the first related successful request.

In other cases, you receive one of the following errors:
| Status code | Code                  | Explanation                                                                      |
| ---         | ---                   | ---                                                                              |

### Verify application [POST]
Verify *application* with OTP sent to customer by SMS. To send OTP to customer see [Request application OTP](#reference/application-operations/request-application-otp) method.

Use `/financing/v1/applications/{applicationId}/verify` resource with properly filled request that contains customer's OTP in request.

+ Request (application/json; charset=utf-8)
    + Attributes (VerifyRequest, required)


+ Response 200(application/json; charset=utf-8)

    + Attributes (Errors)


## Send application additional data [/financing/v1/applications/{applicationId}/additionalData]
If you want to integrate gathering customer additional data needed for completing the *application* into merchant's checkout, this method is needed for completing the *application* with the additional data.

This operation is needed because of some customers' applications, that are not approved/rejected just with data send in *Create application*, but they are approved/rejected after additional data are sent.

To determine what additional data is needed see `additionalData` array on *application* ([Application detail](#reference/application-operations/application-detail)).

 > IMPORTANT NOTE: It's always necessary to check *application* `stateReason`. If `stateReason` after sending additional data is still `stateReason == PROCESSING_ADDITIONAL_DATA` check `additionalData` for new data to send.

| Financing type     | Supported |
| ---                | ---       |
| `DEFERRED_PAYMENT` | YES       |

| Application state | Availability                                     |
| ---               | ---                                              |
| `PROCESSING`      | YES (`stateReason = PROCESSING_ADDITIONAL_DATA`) |
| `REJECTED`        | NO                                               |
| `CANCELLED`       | NO                                               |
| `READY`           | NO                                               |

Possible *application* `state` and `stateReason` after calling this operation:
1. Application state `READY` or `REJECTED` if sent application data are processed and checked so *application* is completed.
1. Application state `PROCESSING` with state reason `PROCESSING_ADDITIONAL_DATA` if there are more additional data needed.
    * For example: customer is firstly asked to add `PERSONAL_ID`. After sending personal id via this operation system evaluate that it's not enough and customer is asked to add `ID_CARD_NO`.
1. Application state `PROCESSING` with state reason `PROCESSING_REVIEW` if the manual review of application is needed. There is no way how to complete *application* in this state throught API calls or via redirection to `gatewayRedirectUrl`.
1. Application state `PROCESSING` with state reason `PROCESSING_VERIFICATION` if additional data was processed and checked so *application* can be completed by verify application process (see [Verify application](#reference/application-operations/verify-application) method). Other way how to complete *application* is to redirect customer to `gatewayRedirectUrl`.
1. Application state `PROCESSING` with state reason `PROCESSING_REDIRECT_NEEDED` if there is no way how to complete *application* throught API calls and you have to redirect customer to `gatewayRedirectUrl`.
